      <description>print(&amp;ldquo;Hello World!&amp;rdquo;)
The variants of this line of code is probably what you wrote when you first learned to program. Heck, I even wrote this 3 times (Hack, Android, IOS) in the past week during Facebook&amp;rsquo;s Bootcamp, the companies ramp-up program for all new employees.
Speaking of Facebook, I began my first real job 2 weeks ago, and I meant to write this post to coincide with my first day of work and the start to my &amp;ldquo;adult&amp;rdquo; life.</description>

      <description>I put this in a private Github repo two years ago, but never published it because for some reason Github did not display markdown properly and I couldn&amp;rsquo;t bold text by using ** **.
I was playing Maplestory several weeks ago (right before finals oops) and I came across a stat boosting feature called inner ability. Without getting into too much details, inner ability gives a character additional benefits which are randomly generated depending on the rarity of the inner ability.</description>
