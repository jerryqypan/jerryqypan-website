      <description>I put this in a private Github repo two years ago, but never published it because for some reason Github did not display markdown properly and I couldn&amp;rsquo;t bold text by using ** **.
I was playing Maplestory several weeks ago (right before finals oops) and I came across a stat boosting feature called inner ability. Without getting into too much details, inner ability gives a character additional benefits which are randomly generated depending on the rarity of the inner ability.</description>
